# Data Job Market Analysis

# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Excel:** Excel Filtering: Used to quickly sort and filter data based on criteria such as location (India), job titles.
Power Query: Utilized for cleaning and transforming large datasets to prepare them for analysis, saving time and improving accuracy.
- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Google Collab:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Microsost Power BI:** 
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Filter India Jobs

To focus the analysis on the India job market, I used Excel to filter job data based on relevant criteria, such as location, keywords, or country-specific fields. This allowed me to isolate job listings specific to India for further insights and analysis.
